# Test Editor Skill 3

This skill demonstrates the unified save_skill tool with skill-relative paths.

## Features

- Created via save_skill (not create_skill)
- Paths are relative to the skill directory
- Includes a template file

## Usage

This is a test skill. Use it to verify that:
1. New skills can be created with save_skill
2. File paths work correctly (e.g., 'SKILL.md' not 'skills/test-editor-skill-3/SKILL.md')
3. Multiple files can be created in one call
