# Soil Parameter Reference Guide

This guide provides interpretation guidelines for common soil test parameters.

## pH (Soil Acidity/Alkalinity)

### Classification Scale

| 5.5 - 6.0 | Moderately acidic | Suitable for acid-loving plants |
| 6.0 - 6.5 | Slightly acidic | Optimal for most crops |
| 6.5 - 7.0 | Neutral | Optimal nutrient availability |
| 7.0 - 7.5 | Slightly alkaline | Acceptable for most crops |
| 7.5 - 8.0 | Moderately alkaline | Iron, manganese, zinc deficiency possible |
| 8.0 - 8.5 | Strongly alkaline | Micronutrient deficiencies common |
| > 8.5 | Very strongly alkaline | Sodium issues possible; remediation needed |

### pH by Crop Type

## Macronutrients

### Nitrogen (N)

Nitrogen is highly mobile and values fluctuate seasonally.

| Level (ppm) | Rating | Recommendation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| < 10 | Very Low | Significant N fertilization needed |
| 10 - 20 | Low | Moderate N fertilization needed |
| 20 - 40 | Medium | Light N application or organic sources |
| 40 - 60 | Adequate | Maintain with cover crops |
| > 60 | High | Reduce N inputs; leaching risk |

### Phosphorus (P)

Interpretation varies by test method (Bray, Olsen, Mehlich).

**Bray-1 / Mehlich-3 (acidic soils)**:

| Level (ppm) | Rating | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| < 5 | Very Low | Severe deficiency likely |
| 5 - 15 | Low | Deficiency symptoms possible |
| 15 - 30 | Medium | Adequate for most crops |
| 30 - 50 | High | No additional P needed |
| > 50 | Very High | Environmental concern; reduce inputs |

**Olsen (alkaline soils)**:

| Level (ppm) | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| < 5 | Low |
| 5 - 12 | Medium |
| > 12 | High |

### Potassium (K)

| Level (ppm) | Rating | Recommendation |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| < 60 | Very Low | Heavy K fertilization needed |
| 60 - 120 | Low | Moderate K needed |
| 120 - 180 | Medium | Light K application |
| 180 - 250 | Adequate | Maintenance levels only |
| > 250 | High | No K needed |

## Secondary Nutrients

### Calcium (Ca)

| Level (ppm) | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| < 500 | Low |
| 500 - 1000 | Medium |
| 1000 - 2500 | Adequate |
| > 2500 | High |

### Magnesium (Mg)

| Level (ppm) | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| < 50 | Low |
| 50 - 100 | Medium |
| 100 - 300 | Adequate |
| > 300 | High |

### Sulfur (S)

| Level (ppm) | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| < 5 | Low |
| 5 - 10 | Medium |
| > 10 | Adequate |

## Important Nutrient Ratios

### Ca:Mg Ratio

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| < 2:1 | Excess Mg; Ca deficiency possible |
| 2:1 - 4:1 | Acceptable |
| 5:1 - 7:1 | Ideal range |
| > 10:1 | Excess Ca; Mg deficiency possible |

### K:Mg Ratio

| Ratio | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| < 0.1 | K deficiency possible |
| 0.2 - 0.3 | Ideal |
| > 0.5 | K excess; Mg uptake inhibited |

## Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)

CEC indicates soil's ability to hold nutrients.

| CEC (meq/100g) | Soil Type | Management |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| < 5 | Sandy | Frequent, light fertilization |
| 5 - 15 | Loamy | Standard management |
| 15 - 25 | Clay loam | Good nutrient retention |
| > 25 | Clay | Excellent retention; harder to change pH |

## Organic Matter (OM)

| OM (%) | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| < 1.0 | Very Low | Poor structure; low water holding |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Low | Needs organic amendments |
| 2.0 - 4.0 | Medium | Typical agricultural soil |
| 4.0 - 6.0 | High | Good soil health |
| > 6.0 | Very High | Excellent; typical of prairie soils |

## Electrical Conductivity (EC / Salinity)

| EC (dS/m) | Rating | Crop Impact |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 0 - 2 | Non-saline | No yield loss |
| 2 - 4 | Slightly saline | Sensitive crops affected |
| 4 - 8 | Moderately saline | Many crops affected |
| 8 - 16 | Strongly saline | Only tolerant crops |
| > 16 | Very strongly saline | Few crops survive |

## Micronutrients

### DTPA-Extractable (typical method)

| Nutrient | Low | Medium | High | Unit |
|----------|-----|--------|------|------|
| Iron (Fe) | < 2.5 | 2.5-4.5 | > 4.5 | ppm |
| Manganese (Mn) | < 1.0 | 1.0-2.0 | > 2.0 | ppm |
| Zinc (Zn) | < 0.5 | 0.5-1.0 | > 1.0 | ppm |
| Copper (Cu) | < 0.2 | 0.2-0.5 | > 0.5 | ppm |
| Boron (B) | < 0.5 | 0.5-1.0 | > 1.0 | ppm |

## Soil Texture

Texture affects water holding, drainage, and nutrient behavior.

### Particle Size Classes

| Particle | Size Range |
|----------|------------|
| Sand | 0.05 - 2.0 mm |
| Silt | 0.002 - 0.05 mm |
| Clay | < 0.002 mm |

### Quality Check

Sand% + Silt% + Clay% should equal 100% (±2% tolerance for rounding).

## Regional Considerations

### Midwest US
- Generally neutral to slightly acidic
- High CEC soils common
- Watch for K depletion in continuous corn

### Southeast US
- Acidic, weathered soils
- Low CEC; frequent liming needed
- Phosphorus fixation common

### Western US
- Alkaline soils common
- Micronutrient deficiencies (Fe, Zn, Mn)
- Salinity issues in irrigated areas

### Pacific Northwest
- Acidic soils common
- High organic matter in many areas
- Sulfur deficiency increasing

## Lab Method Notes

### pH Methods
- **1:1 (soil:water)**: Most common; slightly higher than CaCl2
- **1:2 CaCl2**: More stable reading; typically 0.5 units lower

### Phosphorus Methods
- **Bray-1**: Best for acidic soils (pH < 7.0)
- **Olsen**: Best for alkaline soils (pH > 7.0)
- **Mehlich-3**: Universal extractant; works for most soils

### Potassium Methods
- **Ammonium acetate**: Most common
- **Mehlich-3**: Increasingly used as universal extractant

Values between methods are NOT directly comparable without conversion factors.
